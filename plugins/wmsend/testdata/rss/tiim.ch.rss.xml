            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
            
            <p>In this blog post, I will explain why server-side rendering with the 
              <a href="https://webmention.rocks/test/1" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">urql</a>
              GraphQL library is not as straightforward to do with SvelteKit, 
              and how I solved this in my project anyway.
            </p>
            <p>Server-side rendering (SSR) is one of the great features of SvelteKit. 
              I will try to keep this blog post short and will therefore not explain what
              server-side rendering is and why you should take advantage of it 
              <em>(you really should!)</em>.
               If you want to know more about SSR you can take a look at this article: 
               <a href="https://webmention.rocks/test/2" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">A Deep Dive into Server-Side Rendering (SSR) in JavaScript</a>
               .
            </p>
            <h2>Background - SSR in SvelteKit</h2>
            <p>SvelteKit implements SSR by providing a 
              <a href="https://webmention.rocks/test/3" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>load</code> function</a> 
              for every layout and page component. If a page or layout needs to 
              perform some asynchronous operation, this should be done inside of this 
              load function. SvelteKit executes this function asynchronously on the server 
              side as well as on the client side and the return value of this function is 
              assigned to the <code>data</code> prop of the associated component.
            </p>
            <h2>Background - @urql/svelte</h2>
            <p>The urql library allows us to easily issue GraphQL queries and mutations. 
              Some of the functionality it has to make our lives easier include:
            </p>
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            The client gets a <a href="https://webmention.rocks/test/4" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">special fetch function</a> 
            from the event which has a few nice properties, like preventing a second network request on the client side if that same request was just issued on the server-side.</p>
            <h3>The solution: A query in the load function and a query in the component</h3>
            <p><a href="https://webmention.rocks/test/5" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Link to the Gist</a></p>
            <h2>End remarks</h2>
            <p>Even though I think this solution is not too bad, I wish @urql/svelte would implement a better way to handle SSR with sveltekit. I posted a 
              <a href="https://webmention.rocks/test/6" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">question on the urql GitHub discussions board</a>, but I have not gotten any response yet.</p>
            <p>If this post helped you, or you found a better or different way to solve SSR with urql, please let me know in the comments, write me an email or tag me on twitter 
              <a href="https://webmention.rocks/test/7" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">@TiimB</a>.</p>
